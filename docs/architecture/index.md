## Architecture Drift Flow

- `repo-harness run architecture-queue` records architecture-sensitive edits as requests.
- `repo-harness run archive-architecture-request` archives handled requests after an agent records the resolution status and linked artifacts.
- `repo-harness run context-contract-sync` keeps only the controlled architecture block in functional-block `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files aligned.
- `repo-harness run workstream-sync` keeps durable multi-session progress under `tasks/workstreams/<domain>/<capability>/` and projects only pointers into local contracts.
- Semantic architecture diagrams live as Mermaid fenced blocks in the relevant module or snapshot Markdown.
- Human-readable architecture diagrams are optional `mermaid` HTML files in `docs/architecture/diagrams/` and should link back to the Markdown semantic source.
